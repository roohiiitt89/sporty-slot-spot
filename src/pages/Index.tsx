I don't have the full content of `src/pages/Index.tsx` to provide a complete replacement. The AI only suggested a targeted fix for line 246 where there was an error with passing a `className` prop to a component that doesn't accept it.

Without seeing the full file, I can only provide the pattern for the fix:

```jsx
// Instead of:
<EnterChallengeButton className="whatever-class" />

// Change to:
<div className="whatever-class">
  <EnterChallengeButton />
</div>
```

To properly fix this issue, I would need to see the full content of the `src/pages/Index.tsx` file, particularly the code around line 246 where the error occurs.
